1. Declare a function _fullName_ and it print out your full name.
2. Declare a function _fullName_ and now it takes firstName, lastName as a 
parameter and it returns your full - name.
3. Declare a function _addNumbers_ and it takes two two parameters and 
it returns sum.

4. An area of a rectangle is calculated as follows: 
_area = length x width_. Write a function which calculates _areaOfRectangle_.
5. A perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as follows: 
_perimeter= 2x(length + width)_. Write a function which calculates 
_perimeterOfRectangle_.
6. A volume of a rectangular prism is calculated as follows: 
_volume = length x width x height_. Write a function which calculates 
_volumeOfRectPrism_.
*/

console.log(`Perimeter of Rectangle: ${perimeterOfRectangle(5, 20)}`)

function volOfRectPrism(len, width, height) {
    return len * width * height
}
console.log(`Vol of Rect: ${volOfRectPrism(5, 20, 5)}`)
/*
7. Area of a circle is calculated as follows: 
_area = π x r x r_. Write a function which calculates _areaOfCircle_
8. Circumference of a circle is calculated as follows: 
_circumference = 2πr_. Write a function which calculates _circumOfCircle_
*/
function areaOfCircle(radius) {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius
}

/*
9. Density of a substance is calculated as follows:
_density= mass/volume_. Write a function which calculates _density_.
10. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance covered by 
a moving object divided by the total amount of time taken. 
Write a function which calculates a speed of a moving object, _speed_.
11. Weight of a substance is calculated as follows: 
_weight = mass x gravity_. Write a function which calculates _weight_.
12. Temperature in oC can be converted to oF using this formula: 
_oF = (oC x 9/5) + 32_. Write a function which convert oC to oF 
_convertCelsiusToFahrenheit_.
13. Body mass index(BMI) is calculated as follows: 
_bmi = weight in Kg / (height x height) in m2_. 
Write a function which calculates _bmi_. 
BMI is used to broadly define different weight groups in 
adults 20 years old or older.Check if a person is 
_underweight, normal, overweight_ or _obese_ based the information given below.

    - The same groups apply to both men and women.
    - _Underweight_: BMI is less than 18.5
    - _Normal weight_: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
    - _Overweight_: BMI is 25 to 29.9
    - _Obese_: BMI is 30 or more

14. Write a function called _checkSeason_, it takes a month parameter and returns the season:Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.
15. Math.max returns its largest argument. Write a function findMax that takes three arguments and returns their maximum with out using Math.max method.

    ```js
    console.log(findMax(0, 10, 5))
    10
    console.log(findMax(0, -10, -2))
    0
    ```
